# Becoming (and staying) a high-performant organization

Low lead times (the time taken from recognising a need for a feature or fix until it is put into production), and deployment frequency have been proven to be two key indicator of a highly performant team and organization, and there is a lot of discussion around these and the other two of the four key metrics, ever since the Accelerate book came out.

However, why do we care about these metrics (are they really needed to be a highly performant organization?), and how do you go about achieving and (perhaps more importantly) maintaining low lead times and a high deployment frequency?

In this talk I'll be presenting some of the key aspects of a baseline of a development framework which can help you on your way towards becoming a high-performance organization. I'll cover three key aspects, one for each of:

- Process: how requirements should come into a team
- People: how to structure teams around processes, and why
- Architecture: using reactive, event-driven systems with event sourcing to achieve low coupling

While the above points are just a small selection from a comprehensive framework, these were selected because adopting the principles presented should allow you to see an immediate impact in the ability of your team to deliver value to customers.
