# Becoming a high-performance team
## (and how to stay one)

---

## Schedule

1. Definition of high-performance - 5mins
1. Process - 5mins
1. Architecture - 5mins
1. Team structure - 5 mins
1. Q & A - 10mins

# Definition of high performance

---

<!-- header: "Definition of high performance"-->
# A high-performance organization has:

- Small lead times
- Low waste
- Very low change failure rates
- A meaningful definition of value (hint: it's not always money or customer satisfaction)

# Process

<!-- header: "Process"-->
# Process overview

1. Story mapping
1. Event storm
1. Analyse, update model, implement just-in-time
   - Split work to sub-day sizes
   - Periodically go back to 1.
1. Many mini-retros

*: For a _specific_ definition of value

# Architecture

<!-- header: "Architecture"-->
# Side-tracking: Benefits of a good architecture

- Not _only_ performance and availability
  - Changes are easy
  - Changes do not cascade
  - Changes are targeted
  - All architectures have tradeoffs

<!-- 
All of which are necessary for short cycle times
Note the absence of easy and zero downtime deployments 
  -> Deployment is hard or easy depends on technical details
  -> Zero downtime deployment may not be needed at all, so not necessarily a benefit

## Restrict dependencies & Reduce coupling

<!-- 
MULTIPLE other points. The above are just two of the most important ones. Others:

- Architect "heavily inspired" from collaborative model
- Separate logical boundaries (even if running in same process)
- Maintainability-> Easy to support
- Prefer performance with un-availability in face of partitions.

-->

## Restrict dependencies

- Top tip: visualize dependencies with C4 container diagrams clearly indicating public contracts
- Dependencies should form DAG
- Split semantic data and store only where it's used
- Use local caches of data
- Duplicate data types

<!-- 
â€¢ !!Avoid semantic grouping of data!! Most common pitfall. Think processes.
â€¢ Check to see, but vast majority of processes can live with stale data

â€¢ Split\distribute data when it enters your system
â€¢ Any dependencies must form a DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph)
â€¢ "Tell don't ask"

An example of customer with name, email, payment info, and bank details

# Reduce coupling

- Avoid temporal coupling
- Avoid behavioural coupling
- Data coupling or stamp coupling

<!-- 
â€¢ Temporal couipling ==> use messaging. Event ECST avoids temporal coupling and is a good first step in modernization projects
â€¢ Avoid behavioural coupling ==> Use events with reactive principles. Avoid commands
â€¢ Avoid behavioural coupling #2 ==> Prefer choreography over 
  - Need to be aware that choreography has issues with error handling of complex workflows
â€¢ Data coupling ==> only have a single COHESIVE place the data is used by. Messages only include it's ID NOTE: NOT always possible
â€¢ If ðŸ‘† is not possible fall-back to stamp / message coupling ==> publish events, observers depend on part of that structure
  - Use local caches of data
  - Duplicate definitions (don't share library)

# People

<!-- header: "People" -->
# Teams

- Small, cross-functional teams
- Teams form around business processes
- "The business" is collocated with developers
- Decision happen internally

<!-- 
â€¢ Small teams need less coordination
â€¢ Have teams own core services along with supportive that the core needs.
â€¢ Team per core BC ideal -> if more, this is a risk of dependency of one team with the other
â€¢ Team should be empowered. For this they need to be able to make their own decisions
