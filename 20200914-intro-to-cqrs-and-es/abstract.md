# Intro to CQRS\ES and Q&A with Savvas Kleanthous

In this event I will be doing a quick introduction to Command-Query Responsibility Seggregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES), with a focus on what they are (and perhaps more imnportantly what they aren't), before opening the floor for questions.

In this second section of the meetup, people will be given a chance to ask any question they may have about CQRS and ES, like:

1. Can\Should you use event streaming platforms to do event sourcing?
2. Is event sourcing really complicated?
3. Why are CQRS and ES always mentioned together?
4. Do you need to do DDD to succeed with CQRS and ES?
5. What are the biggest gotchas when working with CQRS and ES?

Due to the limited time we'll have for this event, I may not be able to answer all questions, but if there is interest, we may repeat the event later in the month.

NOTE: this event is happening during UK's lunch as this was the most popular vote when I asked this question on twitter https://twitter.com/SKleanthous/status/1304011375312883712 However, we may schedule another event in an afternoon at a later date if there is interest.
