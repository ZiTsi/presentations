# Preparation material

During this workshop we'll be modelling a parcel delivery domain using big-picture event storming. Due to the limited time, the focus of the workshop is conveying how big-picture event storming can:

- Be used to explore an unknown domain
- Help assure that everyojne understands the same thing (creates shared understanding)
- Make problems visible
- (If we have time) make natural service boundaries visible (useful in system decomposition)

For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume we're all working for the fictitious "LogisticsTurnkeySoftware Ltd". LogisticsTurnkeySoftware is developing logistics solutions that allows major retailers and fulfillment houses to optimize the cost of shipping with courriers. However, in some of our market analysis we found out that some of the recipients of packages are having a bad delivery experience, because they do not correctly understand what they need to do in the case of some exceptions in delivery. Due to this, LogisticsTurnkeySoftware ltd decided we want to develop a tracking service that will convey the status of the shipment in an easy-to-understand way, and also clearly guide the recipient along any actions needed to resolve any exceptions that may exist.

Currently LogisticsTurnkeySoftware ltd does not have any tracking solutions, and the team (you) do not have experience or deep knowledge of this part of logistics, outside of some domain experts (a couple of people who have deep knowledge of statuses and resolving exceptions). However, LogisticsTurnkeySoftware ltd has heard of big-picture event storming, and decided to bring in a consultant to help guarantee that everyone who will be building this product has a shared understanding of how things work and knows where the problems are.
