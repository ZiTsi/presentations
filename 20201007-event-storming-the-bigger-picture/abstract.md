# Event Storming: the bigger picture

In this workshop we'll be running a hands-on, collaborative big picture event storming session. We designed it so that it is close to how a real-life event storming session would be. This will allow you to more accurately assess event storming as a workshop, and experience it's value and understand why it works when other workshops wouldn't.

Contrast to other time-limited workshops, in this workshop we will split into two well-sized and focused teams, each of which will have it's own dedicated facilitator and one subject matter expert, who will participate actively in the event storming session. The schedule will be:

- A very short introduction to how the workshop will run, introduction to the team running the workshop, and then splitting into teams
- 1st part of event storming session with just events
- Short break while the facilitator uses the narrative and pivotal events tools
- 2nd part of event storming session
- Teams merge back and reflect on the workshop

Through the above workshop, participants will be able to learn what event storming is, an introduction on how to run a big-picture event storming session, but perhaps more importantly, experience why event storming is such a powerful tool in a modern products team toolbox.
