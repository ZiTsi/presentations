# Why event storming?

---

# What is it?

- Highly collaborative modelling session
- Focusing on the events of a system
- Immensely powerful

---

# What makes it useful?

- Easy to experiment and refactor

---

# Why not something else?

Event modelling comes close, but lacks on brainstorming aspect

Mainly lacking:

- Brainstorming
- Ease of refactoring
- Different scopes
- Ability to involve SME's
