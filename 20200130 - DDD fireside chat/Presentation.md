# Inspiration

Some years ago at a DDDx...

<!-- "Are we missing something from DDD" -->
<!-- Question was about tactical: needed to load a collection of VO's from a repo -->

---

# Even if we're not "missing" anything..

<!-- - There are a lot of problems a new team faces when trying to adopt DDD for the first time -->

---

# Things I wish I knew 8 years ago:

### 1. DDD is actually made up of a lot of principles and **very** few rules.
### 2. No matter the domain: someone already did most of the difficult parts. _Probably_ by hand.

<!-- Which is just another way of saying: trust the requirements first before anything else -->

# How does it work?

1. Write what you want to talk about and stick it on the whiteboard
1. Vote on what you want to speak about

---

# Hints - what to speak / ask about:

- What problem did you face?
- What did or didn't worked for you?
- What _should_ have worked but _didn't_?
- What unconventional thing did you do, which proved valuable?
