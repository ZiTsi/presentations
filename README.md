# My presentations

## How to build them

The presentations were built using [Marp](https://marp.app/) and using Visual Studio Code with the [Marp plugin installed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode).

Open the presentation inside VS Code and you'll be able to view, edit, and build the presentations.

Alternatively, from the CLI just run `npx @marp-team/marp-cli {NameOfPresentation}.md -o {NameOfPresentation}.html` to convert the presentation into html.
