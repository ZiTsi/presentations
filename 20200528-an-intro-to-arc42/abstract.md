# An introduction to arc42

arc42 is simply a template for documenting the architecture of a system. What makes it interesting is that this template was structured in such a way that it guides the architect to:

1. Focus in what is required
2. Author the architectural documentation in a way that facilitates communication, to all parties
3. Cover all aspects that are useful

But while it's just a template, it is useful, and of interest for a number of key reasons.

During this talk I will be presenting arc42, what it is, and how to author architectural documentation based on the arc42 template. More specifically, we'll start with a brief intoduction of arc42 and why it may be of interest, before going into a more detailed explanation of each of the 12 sections that arc42 contains, along with guidelines to help you fill in each section. We'll also briefly touch on the relationship of arc42 and the C4 model, and how the two can work together.

After the overview, I'll be going over my experience with arc42, compare it with a couple of different approaches, and give my opinion of arc42 and it's use in a modern, fast-moving environment.

By the end of the talk you should:

- Have an understanding of what arc42 is and what it is good for
- Know what information belongs in each section
- Have a basic understanding of how to fill in arc42
- Be aware of a couple of pitfalls
