# Becoming (and staying) a high-performance organization

The Accelerate book (Forsgren, Humble, Kim) succeeded in providing indications of what makes a high-performance organization, along with insight on the science behind the research. The findings are as valuable as they are unsurprising.

However, while there is a lot of information describing the characteristics and indicators of high performers, the actionable information inside of the Accelerate is limited and focused, still leaving gaps for organizations on their way to achieve high performance. This was something I faced in my current position. I joined as a tech lead / architect, but I quickly moved to a department head position, where I needed to establish a process which helped my team deliver.

In this talk I'll present an "inverted" view of a framework which I've been working on, to help my organization (and hopefully others) become highly performant. Instead of presenting the framework directly, I will instead present six important characteristics a sociotechnical system should exhibit, and explain what you need to do to achieve these. This will allow you to get an immediate value from the process, by allowing you to introduce people, process, and design changes with a focus on the outcome.
